	abstract = {This study focuses on CS minor students' decisions to drop out from the CS1 course. The high level of drop out percentage has been a problem at Helsinki University of Technology for many years. This course has yearly enrolment of 500-600 students and the drop out percentage has varied from 30-50 percents.Since we did not have clear picture of drop out reasons we conducted a qualitative interview research in which 18 dropouts from the CS1 course were interviewed. The reasons of drop out were categorized and, in addition, each case was investigated individually. This procedure enabled us to both list the reasons and to reveal the cumulative nature of drop out reasons.The results indicate that several reasons affect students' decision to quit the CS1 course. The most frequent reasons were the lack of time and the lack of motivation. However, both of these reasons were in turn affected by factors, such as the perceived difficulty of the course, general difficulties with time managing and planning studies, or the decision to prefer something else. Furthermore, low comfort level and plagiarism played a role in drop out. In addition, drop out reasons cumulated.This study shows that the complexity and large variety of factors involved in students' decision to drop the course. This indicates that simple actions to improve teaching or organization on a CS1 course to reduce drop out may be ineffective. Efficient intervention to the problem apparently requires a combination of many different actions that take into consideration the versatile nature of reasons involved in drop out.},

	abstract = {Online learning and assessments have become an integral part of education systems around the world. Online education and learning stand out as one of the important applications of cognitive computing where artificial intelligence - based models can be built by taking into account cognitive abilities of the students such as working memory, retention power, reasoning skills etc. The systems used for online assessment can be better designed considering some factors effecting learning environments and cognitive abilities of the learners. These factors such as sleep hours, time of the day, noise level, environment settings and mood etc. are closely linked with his/ her cognitive skills and affective state which in turn may effect performance in online assessment. This paper attempts to identify the effect of mood, sleep hours, time of the day and energy level on the performance of engineering students in an online assessment in India. The students have attempted the test on Moodle (2.9.0) in three sessions in a day viz. morning, afternoon and late afternoon. Sleep hours and energy level have been captured using a set of questions embedded within the online test items. Mood has been captured by the pictorial representation of various moods using robotic characters during the test. One -way ANOVA has been used as statistical measure to test various hypotheses. The study reported that sleep hours and perceived energy level during various times of the day had no significant effect on the performance of students. However, mood and time of the day had an impact on the students’ performance. Higher number of students performed the best in the morning hours of the day. Also, students with positive moods performed better than students who reported negative mood. The findings from this study can be used for designing a framework of an adaptive tutor based on cognitive skills for teaching different subjects to students.},

In particular, our analysis confirms the complexity of the decision to drop, with students citing a combination of interrelated factors that contribute to the decision. Lack of time, combined with ineffective study strategies or with a prioritization of other courses, were the most commonly cited combinations of factors. Interestingly, when compared to the experience of students who chose to complete the course, there is evidence that students encounter a decision point when they realize they are or soon will be behind. Students who drop speak of focusing on other priorities or being unable to catch up, while students who complete speak of understanding the need to use new techniques for learning and increasing their efforts.},

For this reason, the goal of this article is to analyze which factors affect repeaters so that a specific learning strategy for them can be performed. In this regard, a first analysis of a CS1 course shows there are two types of repeaters: (1) those who do (almost) nothing throughout the semester and drop out, and (2) those who work during the whole semester, but finally fail. According to repeaters’ perceptions, they were motivated to learn to program, but it was difficult for them to keep up because of it was so hard to reconcile it with their personal context, so based on what they did the previous semester, they would prefer to continue from where they left off or change the pace of activities.},

	abstract = {Undergraduate computer science (CS) programs often suffer from high dropout rates. Recent research suggests that self-efficacy -- an individual's belief in their ability to complete a task -- can influence whether students decide to persist in CS. Studies show that students' self-assessments affect their self-efficacy in many domains, and in CS, researchers have found that students frequently assess their programming ability based on their expectations about the programming process. However, we know little about the specific programming experiences that prompt the negative self-assessments that lead to lower self-efficacy. In this paper, we present findings from a survey study with 214 CS1 students from three universities. We used vignette-style questions to describe thirteen programming moments which may prompt negative self-assessments, such as getting syntax errors and spending time planning. We found that many students across all three universities reported that they negatively self-assess at each of the thirteen moments, despite the differences in curriculum and population. Furthermore, those who report more frequent negative self-assessments tend to have lower self-efficacy. Finally, our findings suggest that students' perceptions of professional programming practice may influence their expectations and negative self-assessments. By reducing the frequency that students self-assess negatively while programming, we may be able to improve self-efficacy and decrease dropout rates in CS.},

We find that a student's midterm score can be tractably predicted with simple measures such as the student's average number of errors, number of pairs of compilations in error, number pairs of compilations with the same error, pairs of compilations with the same edit location and pairs of compilations with the same error location.

	abstract = {There are significant participation gaps in computing, and the way to address these participation gaps lies not simply in getting students from underrepresented groups into a CS1 classroom, but supporting students to pursue their interest in computing further beyond CS1. There are many factors that may influence students’ pursuit of computing beyond introductory courses, including their sense that they can do what CS courses require of them (their self-efficacy) and positive emotional experiences in CS courses. When interest has been addressed in computing education, research has treated it mostly as an outcome of particular pedagogical approaches or curricula; what has not been studied is how students’ longer-term interest develops through more granular experiences that students have as they begin to engage with computing. In this paper, we present the results of a study designed to investigate how students’ interest in computing develops as a product of their momentary self-efficacy and affective experiences. Using a methodology that is relatively uncommon to computer science education—the experience sampling method, which involves frequently asking students brief, unobtrusive questions about their experiences—we surveyed CS1 students every week over the course of a semester to capture the nuances of their experiences. 74 CS1 students responded 14-18 times over the course of a semester about their self-efficacy, frustration, and situational interest. With this data, we used a multivariate, multi-level statistical model that allowed us to estimate how students’ granular, momentary experiences (measured through the experience sampling method surveys) and initial interest, self-efficacy, and self-reported gender (measured through traditional surveys) relate to their longer-term interest and achievement in the course. We found that students’ momentary experiences have a significant impact on their interest in computing and course outcomes, even controlling for the self-efficacy and interest students reported at the beginning of the semester. We also found significant gender differences in students’ momentary experiences, however, these were reduced substantially when students’ self-efficacy was added to the model, suggesting that gender gaps could instead be self-efficacy gaps. These results suggest that students’ momentary experiences in CS1, how they experience the course week to week, have an impact on their longer-term interest and learning outcomes. Furthermore, we found that male and female students reported different experiences, suggesting that improving the CS1 experiences that students have could help to close gender-related participation gaps. In all, this study shows that the granular experiences students have in CS1 matter for key outcomes of interest to computing education researchers and educators and that the experience sampling method, more common in fields adjacent to computer science education, provides one way for researchers to integrate the experiences students have into our accounts of why students become interested in computing.},

Risk weights are assigned to students based on the journal response's sentiment analysis and whether student's 2dimensional grid responses fall within configurable 'danger zone' bounds. The early warning system automatically flags students as needing support if the responses' combined risk weights exceed configurable thresholds.

	abstract = {While computer science (CS) education researchers have frequently examined what happens in courses, programs of study, or occupations in general, they have less frequently addressed finer-grained experiences that spark students' interest in CS. One excellent way to study these types of student experiences is the Experience Sampling Method (ESM). ESM involves collecting data on individuals' experiences at much more frequent intervals than traditional survey research. This aspect of ESM makes it well-suited to examine time-specific aspects of students' experiences, as well as changes due to the disruptive effects of COVID-19.},
